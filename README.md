This repository holds a Deep Learning Reaserch Project dedicated to the paper titled Realistic Evaluation of Deep Semi-Supervised
Learning Algorithms.  Our work is about implementation of realistic semi-supervised learning methods used in Deep Learning.
Given a dataset with missing targets, the supervised learning approach can not be used for classification. To face the lack of label, Semi-Supervised Learning methods are used.
In the paper studied, the following methods are presented: Pi-Model, Mean teacher, Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT), Entropy Minimization (EntMin) and Pseudo-Labeling.
We use Pi-Model applied to MNIST data with only 100 labels. We used tensorflow.
