This repository is about the paper titled Realistic Evaluation of Deep Semi-Supervised
Learning Algorithms. We implement the method presented in this paper.
Given a dataset with missing targets, the supervised learning approach can not be used for classification. For fixing this issue, Semi-Supervised Learning method is introduced.
These methods are studied: Pi-Model, Mean teacher, Virtual Adversarial Training (VAT), Entropy Minimization (EntMin) and Pseudo-Labeling.
We use Pi-Model with MNIST data and only 100 labels are used.
